Hello, welcome to my personal webpage and my very first blog post! I am currently still setting up this site, but I thought I would go ahead and make my first post here.

A little about me at the time of writing - I am 23 years old and living in downtown Chicago. I graduated from Purdue University back in December 2018 with a degree in Computer Science and minors in Mathematics and Economics. If you are familiar with the Purdue undergraduate Computer Science curriculum, I completed my degree by meeting the requirements of the "Machine Intelligence" track, meaning I took mostly machine learning, artificial intelligence, and statistics classes. Since graduation, I have been working as a data platform engineer at a financial services company and I will have been working there for exactly two years in just a week and a half from now. I'm also currently enrolled at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign working on a master's degree in Computer Science in Data Science. Currently, my goal is to land a job as a data scientist in the near future.

I wanted to start this page up so that I have a place to document some of my experiences and have a platform to share some of my thoughts. While in undergrad, I thought it would be cool to document my college experiences in some way because living on my own for the first time away from family gave me a lot of freedom to try new things and forced me to grow as a person. I would've liked to have started this site up maybe back in January 2019 when I was fresh out of college because a lot has happened over the past few years, but hey, better late then never.

I'm not totally sure yet how I want to approach writing, how much I want to share, what kind of content I will post, or even how frequently I will post. We will see how this space evolves and changes as time goes on. For now, I'm glad I finally set up this small little platform for myself - and for you guys who are interested in following along.

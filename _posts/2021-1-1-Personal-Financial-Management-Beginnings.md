title: Personal Financial Management Beginnings
---

So, you've just graduated from college, landed a well-paying job, and, while you're by no means a rich Jeff Bezos at this point, you're likely making more money and seeing more money than you ever have before, and it's important to start learning how to manage it.

For the first several months or so since starting my current job, I didn't really pay too much attention to my money. As long as I was paying my monthly debts, contributing to my retirement accounts, and not spending too much on unnecessary things, I was fine. Now that I've worked for a couple of years, I've accumulated a decent amount of cash, and so now I want to be more concious of how my money is being spent and how it is growing. I want to maintain and/or increase my wealth and not let it decay due to inflation or bad investments.

Here are some financial moves I've made and things I've learned so far since starting my career. Note that I'm not a financial expert, nor do I claim to be one, but my hope is that some of you may find this information useful as you begin to plan your strategies and work towards your financial goals. It's also important to note that everyone's situation is different, so everything here that applies to me and my own personal experiences may or may not be applicable to you.

#### Open a Credit Card Account ASAP
One of the very first things I did after starting my job was apply for a credit card. I had a stable income and was living on my own, so it was the perfect time to open a line of credit and build up my credit score.
If your like me, you've finished your bachelor's degree and landed a good job and. I was also fortunate enough to graduate without accruing any student loan debt through a combination of scholarships, enrolling in a in-state school, and financial support from family - a luxury that I am aware that many people do not have.

This isn't applicable to me, but i think is worth mentioning. I would pay off loans as soon as possible

Tips
Treat your credit card like a debit card. Pretend money you are spending today
Make your sure contribute enough to your retirement account so you are getting the full company match
Learn pay stub
keep track of spending and growth

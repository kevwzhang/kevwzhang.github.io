title: Personal Financial Management Beginnings
---

So, you've just graduated from college, landed a well-paying job, and, while you're by no means a rich Jeff Bezos at this point, you're likely making more money and seeing more money than you ever have before, and it's important to start learning how to manage it.

For the first several months or so since starting my current job, I didn't really pay too much attention to my money. As long as I was paying my monthly debts, contributing to my retirement accounts, and not spending too much on unnecessary things, I figured was fine. Now that I've worked for a couple of years, I've accumulated a decent amount of cash, and I want to be more conscientious of how my money is being spent and how it is growing. I want to make sure I maintain and/or increase my wealth and not let it decay due to inflation or bad investments.

Here are some financial moves I've made and things I've learned so far since starting my career. Note that I'm not a financial expert, nor do I claim to be one, so you should definitely fact-check any information I provide here - but my hope is that some of you may find this information useful as you begin to plan your strategies and work towards your financial goals. It's also important to note that everyone's situation is different, so everything here that applies to me and my own personal experiences may or may not be applicable to you.

### Open a Credit Card Account
One of the very first things I did after starting my job was apply for a credit card. I had a stable income and was living on my own, so it was the perfect time to open a line of credit and build up my credit score. I've listed a few advantages of owning a credit card here:
- Secure
    - Credit cards are much more secure than debit cards. If your card number gets stolen and someone makes an unwarranted purchase on your account, you won't lose any money. With a debit card, it can be harder for you to get that money back because the money is immediately taken out of your bank account at the time of purchase. With a credit card, you can contact your provider and ask them to cancel the fraudulent transaction and issue you a new card. Fortunately, I haven't had to deal with a stolen card number yet, but knowing that I have that added security is very nice.
- Rewards
    - Pretty much every credit card offers rewards these days. You already know you have to spend money on essentials like food and transportation and you're likely consistently spending money on non-essentials as well, so why not get rewarded for those purchases? I have a credit card that lets me get 2% cash back on every purchase, so it's almost like I get free money on every purchase, or everything I buy costs 2% less!
- No Annual Fee
    - Some credit cards require you to pay a yearly subscription fee, but some don't! You can get many of these credit card benefits without having to pay for a yearly subscription. I personally don't have any cards that require me to pay an annual fee.
- Allows You to Build Good Credit
    - I haven't needed to take out a loan yet, but if/when I do, I can expect a lower interest rate when paying back loans if I have a good credit score. To increase/maintain a good credit score, I pay my bills in full and on time. A good score shows creditors that you are responsible with your money and they will be less worried about losing their money since you have reliably shown that you can pay back owed money.

Of course, there can be consequences to owning a credit card as well - but these consequences generally only happen when you don't pay credit card bills.
- Increased Interest
    - When you get a bill, you generally have options to pay off the minimum balance, the statement balance, or the current balance. If you pay enough to meet the minimum requirement, but not enough to meet the statement requirement, the difference will be carried over to future bills and accrue interest (calculated based on your card's annual percentage rate or APR value) - so you end up paying more for your purchases than you otherwise would have. If you start missing some payments, that APR (interest) value could go up. I don't think my interest rate has increased, but I also haven't been paying too much attention to that value because I always pay off my statement in full. 
- Late Fees
    - If you miss a payment and pay it off later after the deadline, you'll likely incur some sort of late fee that you also have to pay. I haven't had to pay a late fee and this repercussion can be avoided by paying bills in full and on time.
- Lowers your Credit Score
    - Just like having a credit card could raise your score, it could also lower your score. It all depends on whether or not you're paying your bills. Once again, if you don't want a lower credit score, pay bills in full and on time.

I personally have not had to deal with any of these consequences of owning a credit card. To avoid the consequences, there are two rules I abide by when using a credit card:
1. Treat your credit card as if it was a debit card - meaning don't spend more than you have. Only make purchases if you could theoretically pay for it with hard cash you own.
2. Pay billing statements in full and on time (have I said this enough? it's important haha). As mentioned earlier, this will allow you to reap the benefits of having a credit card without suffering any of the negative consequences.

It can be a bit hard to qualify for a card when you don't have an established credit background. If you're just starting out, the [Discover it®](https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/cash-back/it-card.html) card is one that I recommend and one that might be a bit easier to obtain as a fresh college graduate that's just starting to work. This card lets you get 5% cash back on specific purchases per quarter and 1% on everything else. Plus, for the first year of use, the cash back you get is actually doubled, so essentially you're getting 10% of your money back per quarter and 2% on everything else for the first year. Another popular card is the [Chase Freedom Unlimited®](https://creditcards.chase.com/cash-back-credit-cards/freedom/unlimited) card which can get you a $200 bonus, 1.5% cash back on all purchases, and more. There are a lot of options when it comes to credit cards, so choose the ones that work best for you.

### Contribute to Your 401(k)
A 401(k) is a retirement plan that is sponsored by the employer you work for. There are several different types of 401(k) plans, but I'm only going to talk about the types I've dealt with, which would probably be considered the "two main types" of plans you would see at big corporations. The two plans are the Traditional 401(k) and the Roth 401(k).

Before we talk about the differences between the two types, let's try to more thoroughly understand what a 401(k) is and how it works.

A 401(k) is a retirement plan that is sponsored by your employer. Establishing a 401(k) means you are working with your company to set up a retirement account for yourself. After the account is set up (which is pretty much already done for you as soon as you start working), you can begin setting aside a portion of your paycheck earnings to be put into that account. Every year, the IRS announces the limit for how much money an employee can contribute to his/her retirement account for an entire year. For the year 2021, the limit is $19,500. The limits can change slightly from year to year based on a multitude of reasons, so it's important to check what the limit is at the beginning of every new year.

The main difference between a Traditional 401(k) and a Roth 401(k) is when income taxes are paid off. A contribution to a Traditional 401(k) must be made with "before-tax" dollars and a contribution to a Roth 401(k) must be made with "after-tax" dollars - but what does this mean? Let me illustrate this with a severely simplified example.

Suppose you just got a paycheck for $1,000 and you set aside $200 of that $1,000 into your 401(k) retirement account. Currently, your income tax rate is 10%.

Let's say you put that $200 into a Traditional 401(k) plan. When calculating how much income tax you have to pay on your $1,000 paycheck, you deduct $200 from your $1,000 before multiplying by 10% to get a total of $80 owed in taxes. So at this point, you pay the $80 tax, take home $720 with you, and have $200 in the retirement account. 40 years later, that initial $200 has grown to $20,000, the income tax rate has changed from 10% to 15%, and you still have that $720. Now, you want to make a withdrawal of $1,000. When you withdraw that $1,000, you calculate your tax to be $1,000 multiplied by 15% which is $150. So you pay the $150 tax and take the rest of the $850 home. If we look at the final numbers now, you spent a total of $230 ($80 + $150) in taxes, you have a total of $1,570 ($720 + $850) cash on hand, and $19,000 in your Traditional 401(k) plan.

Now, let's start with the same initial conditions of $1,000, $200, and 10% and see how the taxes are different when using a Roth 401(k).

Let's say you put that $200 into a Roth 401(k) plan. When calculating how much income tax you have to pay on your $1,000 paycheck, you multiply the full $1,000 by 10% to get a total of $100 owed in taxes. So at this point, you pay the $100 tax, take home $700 with you, and have $200 in the retirement account. 40 years later, that initial $200 has grown to $20,000, the income tax rate has changed from 10% to 15%, and you still have that $700. Now, you want to make a withdrawal of $1,000. When you withdraw that $1,000, you withdraw the full $1,000 and pay $0 in tax. If we look at the final numbers now, you spent a total of $100 ($100 + $0) in taxes, you have a total of $1,700 ($700 + $1000) cash on hand, and $19,000 in your Roth 401(k) plan.

So as we can see, when people say that a Traditional 401(k) contribution is made using "before-tax" dollars, they mean that the money you put into the account that comes from a portion of your paycheck does not get taxed (yet). The initial deposit and its subsequent growth gets taxed when you take out the money after retirement. When people say that a Roth 401(k) contribution is made using "after-tax" dollars, they mean that the money you into the account that comes from a portion of your paycheck does get taxed. The initial deposit and its subsequent growth does not get taxed when you take out the money after retirement.

So which option is better, and which type should you invest in?

If all you care about is maintaining a good quality of life after retirement, I think you can't really go wrong with either option. As long as you invest early and make consistent and substantial contributions, your money will grow and you should have enough money to retire on, regardless of the option you chose.

If you do care about making the most bang for your buck, it's hard to say. Based on the example above, you may be inclined to think the Roth 401(k) is clearly better, but this isn't necessarily true. Perhaps, in the example above, you decided to invest in a Traditional 401(k) which means you got to take an extra $20 home today and invest it in some other account. After 40 years, you turned that $20 into $7,500, so you end up with more money overall than you would have if you invested in a Roth 401(k). We also don't know if we will be paying a higher or lower tax rate 40 years into the future - a lower tax rate in the future, unlike my example, could imply it may be better to invest in a Traditional 401(k) now. Depending on your situation, one type of 401(k) may be more advantageous for you than the other.

From what I've read, if you are in a similar position in life as I am, it seems like investing in a Roth 401(k) would be more beneficial in the long run. I expect to probably be in a higher tax bracket in the future, so it might be better to pay taxes now and not deal with them later. Some economists also think that we are enjoying relatively low tax rates, so they are predicting these rates could go up 40 years into the future - but take this with a grain of salt because no one can tell what things will be like 40 years from now.

The other option I would recommend is actually investing in both. If the 401(k) contribution limit this year is $19,500, you could choose to split your contributions 50/50 and invest $9,750 into a Traditional 401(k) and the other $9,750 into a Roth 401(k). In this manner, you implement the important technique of diversifying your investments. You may not see as much growth if you had just put all of your contributions into the "right" type, but you also won't gain too little growth if you put all your contributions into the "wrong" type.

Currently, I'm actually investing in a Traditional 401(k). One reason is that, until recently, I didn't actually have the option to invest in a Roth 401(k). Although I could switch over now, I'm continuing to stick with the Traditional 401(k), at least for the year 2021. The reason is that since my 401(k) contributions are tax-deferred, I won't have to pay taxes on those contributions for the year 2021. This lowers my Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) allowing me to qualify for a tax credit related to my enrollment in graduate school. So essentially, by making Traditional 401(k) contributions, I'm able to lower my taxable income just enough so that I can get the government to cover some of my tuition expenses.

So again, picking a type of plan is purely situational - digest the information I've presented here, but do your own research into the advantages and disadvantages of both and make your own informed decision. Of course, after you pick a type, you have to decide what your investment strategy should look like and what markets you should invest in, but that's a topic for another day.

One more important thing to note regarding 401(k)s - a lot of the times, your employer will offer a match, generally a small percentage value of your salary. Keep in mind though, that the company match contribution is spread out over your many paychecks throughout the year - you're not going to get the full x% in your first paycheck. Therefore, you must spread out your retirement contributions for the year so that you hit the IRS $19,500 limit right at the last paycheck in order to get the full company x% match. At that point, it's almost like the company is giving you free retirement money, so make sure you take full advantage of that by implementing this method. You also have to stay with the company for a certain amount of time (generally a few years or so) if you want to keep the employer contributions for yourself after you leave. Normally, these details and requirements can be found on your job offer.

### Contribute to Your Individual Retirement Account (IRA)
Just as it is important to contribute to your company-sponsored retirement account, it's important to open an individual retirement account and contribute to that. There are a lot of similarities between 401(k)s and IRAs - much of the information stated in the **Contribute to Your 401(k)** section can be applied here.

If you're in a similar position as I am, I'd recommend opening up a Roth IRA. Like the Roth 401(k), you pay taxes on your contributions to your Roth IRA now but in return, you enjoy tax-free growth and withdrawals in the future. Like the Roth 401(k), you can implement an investment strategy that works for you. For 2021, the maximum contribution limit for a Roth IRA is $6,000.

There's a nice [reference from Charles Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/ira/understand-iras/roth-vs-trad-ira) I found that quickly highlights the main difference between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA.

### Understand Your Paycheck
So you just got paid, which is exciting! But what do all the numbers mean?

Another important component of financial literacy is understanding how your money is being divided in your paycheck. Paychecks differ from company to company, but I'll try to address the commonalities all paychecks share.

Let's say you get a paycheck with a **Gross Pay** of $1,000. This is the initial amount of raw dollars you've earned for the pay period. Let's say every paycheck, you choose to allocate 20% of your pay to a 401(k) account. Under the **Deductions** section, you will see a value of $200 since 20% of $1,000 is $200. Under **Taxes**, you'll probably see four main entries:
- Social Security Tax
    - The amount of Social Security Tax you owe is 6.2% of your **Gross Pay**. In this example, the Social Security Tax would be $62.
- Medicare Tax
    - The amount of Medicare Tax you owe is 1.45% of your **Gross Pay**. In this example, the Medicare Tax would be $14.50.
- Federal Withholding
    - Sometimes, your employer will withhold some amount of money for you to pay off income taxes. It's generally a value proportional to your **Gross Pay**. Let's say in this example, $100 is withheld for federal taxes.
- State Tax
    - You also have to pay state taxes on income as well and tax rules vary by state. It's generally a value proportional to your **Gross Pay**. Let's say in this example, $50 is used on state taxes.

These entries sum up to a total of $226.50 for **Taxes**.

**Net Pay**, which is the total amount of money you actually take home with you, is calculated by taking **Gross Pay** and subtracting it by **Deductions** and **Taxes**. In our example, your **Net Pay** is $573.50 since $1,000 - $200 - $226.50 = $573.50.

### Tracking Your Spending and Earnings
So I actually started doing this pretty recently, but I should have done this way, way earlier. I wanted to be more responsible with my money and track how much I spend in different areas of my life.

I keep a spreadsheet detailing every single transaction I make and I would highly recommend everyone create a spreadsheet for themselves to follow their spending and earnings. It doesn't have to be anything fancy. I also use it to keep track of the growth of my accounts. I update values in each of my accounts as transactions are made throughout a month. At the end of each month, I summarize all my transactional information. I sort my expenses into categories so I can see how much I'm spending on groceries, transportation, entertainment, etc., per month and how these values change from month to month. I also look at the difference between my starting and ending balances for each of my accounts so I can see how much they are growing each month. I can utilize all this information to figure out where it is worth my time to invest my money. Keeping track of all my earnings, payments, purchases, and accounts allows me to make improvements, cut down on spending, and give me more control over my finances.

### Paying Off Debts and Loans
So, I can't speak much on this point because I don't have much experience with large loans or large sums of debt. I was fortunate enough to graduate without accruing any student loan debt through a combination of scholarships, enrolling in an in-state school, and financial support from my family. However, if I did find myself in debt, I would try to portion my paycheck so that I could pay as much as I can as soon and as quickly as possible. This would minimize the amount of interest I would have to pay back in the future. I believe the sooner I pay off debt, the better off I'll be in the long run.

**These are just some of the things I've learned about personal finances since starting my career that I wanted to share and document. Hopefully, if you are just starting out your career or even if you have been working for a while, you find this financial information useful!**

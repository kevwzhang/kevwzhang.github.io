I keep really detailed records of all my financials and I wanted to see what my spending has been like for the first six months of this year, so I created some pie charts that show the proportion of money spent on specific categories for each month.

Other expenses here comprises of payments for school and some pricey computer parts I bought to build a maching learning computer that can run models.

Also some big money dropped on tuition payments here.

In total, I spent exactly $23,824.05 so far in 2021 (yikes!). All I'm getting from this is that I need to cook more often so that I'm not spending $$ eating out all the time. Also I throw away too much money on rent payments.

So on average, for the first half of this year, rent made up of 40% of my expenses and tuition made up 34%. Everything else I paid for averages out to be roughly $1000 a month, which is not too bad actually.

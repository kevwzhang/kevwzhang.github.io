title: Personal Financial Management Beginnings
---

So, you've just graduated from college, landed a well-paying job, and, while you're by no means a rich Jeff Bezos at this point, you're likely making more money and seeing more money than you ever have before, and it's important to start learning how to manage it.

For the first several months or so since starting my current job, I didn't really pay too much attention to my money. As long as I was paying my monthly debts, contributing to my retirement accounts, and not spending too much on unnecessary things, I was fine. Now that I've worked for a couple of years, I've accumulated a decent amount of cash, and so now I want to be more concious of how my money is being spent and how it is growing. I want to maintain and/or increase my wealth and not let it decay due to inflation or bad investments.

Here are some financial moves I've made and things I've learned so far since starting my career. Note that I'm not a financial expert, nor do I claim to be one, but my hope is that some of you may find this information useful as you begin to plan your strategies and work towards your financial goals. It's also important to note that everyone's situation is different, so everything here that applies to me and my own personal experiences may or may not be applicable to you.

### Open a Credit Card Account ASAP
One of the very first things I did after starting my job was apply for a credit card. I had a stable income and was living on my own, so it was the perfect time to open a line of credit and build up my credit score. I've listed a few advantages of owning a credit card here:
- Secure
    - Credit cards are much more secure than debit cards. If your card number gets stolen and someone makes an unwarranted purchase on your account, you wont lose any money. With a debit card, it can be harder for you to get that money back because the money is immeditely taken out of your bank account at the time of purchase. With a credit card, you can contact your provider and ask them to cancel the fradulent transaction and issue you a new card. Fortunately, I haven't had to deal with a stolen card number yet, but knowing that I have that added security is very nice.
- Rewards
    - Pretty much every credit card offers rewards these days. You already know you have to spend money on essentials like food and transportation and you're likely consistently spending money on non-essentials as well, so why not get rewarded for those purchases? I have a credit card that lets me get 2% cash back on every purchase, so it's almost like I get free money on every purchase, or everything I buy costs 2% less!
- No Annual Fee
    - Some credit cards require you to pay a yearly subscription fee, buy some don't! You can get many of these credit card benefits without having to pay for a yearly subscription. I personally don't have any cards that require me to pay an annual fee.
- Allows You to Build Good Credit
    - I haven't needed to take out a loan yet, but if/when I do, I can expect a lower interest rate when paying back loans if I have a good credit score. To increase/maintain a good credit score, I pay my bills in full and on time. A good score shows creditors that you are responsible with your money and they will be less worried about losing their money since you have reliably shown that you can pay back owed money.

Of course, there can be consequences to owning a credit card as well - but these consequences generally only happen when you don't pay credit card bills.
- Increased Interest
    - When you get a bill, you generally have options to pay off the minimum balance, the statement balance, or the current balance. If you pay enough to meet the minimum requirement, but not enough to meet the statement requirement, the difference will be carried over to future bills and accrue interest (calculated based on your card's annual percentage rate or APR value) - so you end up paying more for your purchases than you otherwise would have. If you start missing some payments, that APR (interest) value could go up. I don't think my interest rate has increased, but I also haven't been paying too much attention to that value because I always pay off my statement in full. 
- Late Fees
    - If you miss a payment and pay it off later after the deadline, you'll likely incur some sort of late fee that you also have to pay. I haven't had to pay a late fee and this repercussion can be avoided by paying bills in full and on time.
- Lowers your Credit Score
    - Just like having a credit card could raise your score, it could also lower your score. It all depends on whether or not you're paying your bills. Once again, if you don't want a lower credit score, pay bills in full and on time.
The important thing to note is that if you pay every bill in full and on time, you won't expereinece any of these consequences
I personally have not had to deal with any of these consequences of owning a credit card. To avoid the disadvantages, there are two rules I abide by when using a credit card.
Treat your credit card as if it was a debit card - meaning don't spend more than you have.
Pay billing statements in full and on time (have I said this enough? it's important haha). As mentioned earlier, this will allow you to reap the benefits of having a credit card without suffering any of the negative consequences. If you don't it will decrease your credit score. You'll notice a lot of the time you only have to pay back a minimum per month. I have never done this and would highly reccomend not paying just the minimum.

It can be a bit hard to qualify for a card if you're early in your career like me. The Discover IT card is free

### 401k

### IRAs

### Understand your paycheck

### Tracking your spending and earnings
So I actually started doing that this month, but I should have done this way, way earlier.

### Paying off Debts
So, I can't speak much on this point because I don't have any experience with what a good chunk of you experience debt. However, I'm a firm believer in paying off debts as soon and as quickly as possible.

If you're like me, you've finished your bachelor's degree and landed a good job and. I was also fortunate enough to graduate without accruing any student loan debt through a combination of scholarships, enrolling in a in-state school, and financial support from family - a luxury that I am aware that many people do not have.

This isn't applicable to me, but i think is worth mentioning. I would pay off loans as soon as possible

Tips
Treat your credit card like a debit card. Pretend money you are spending today

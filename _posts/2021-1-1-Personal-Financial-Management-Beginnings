title: Personal Financial Management Beginnings
---

So, you've just graduated from college, landed a well-paying job, and, while you're by no means a rich Jeff Bezos at this point, you're likely making more money and seeing more money than you ever have before, and it's important to start learning how to manage it.

For the first several months or so since starting my current job, I didn't really pay too much attention to my money. As long as I was paying my monthly debts, contributing to my retirement accounts, and not spending too much on unnecessary things, I was fine. Now that I've worked for a couple of years, I've accumulated a decent amount of cash, and so now I want to be more concious of how my money is being spent and how it is growing. I want to maintain and/or increase my wealth and not let it decay due to inflation or bad investments.

Here are some financial moves I've made and things I've learned so far since starting my career. Note that I'm not a financial expert, nor do I claim to be one, but my hope is that some of you may find this information useful as you begin to plan your strategies and work towards your financial goals. It's also important to note that everyone's situation is different, so everything here that applies to me and my own personal experiences may or may not be applicable to you.

### Open a Credit Card Account
One of the very first things I did after starting my job was apply for a credit card. I had a stable income and was living on my own, so it was the perfect time to open a line of credit and build up my credit score. I've listed a few advantages of owning a credit card here:
- Secure
    - Credit cards are much more secure than debit cards. If your card number gets stolen and someone makes an unwarranted purchase on your account, you wont lose any money. With a debit card, it can be harder for you to get that money back because the money is immeditely taken out of your bank account at the time of purchase. With a credit card, you can contact your provider and ask them to cancel the fradulent transaction and issue you a new card. Fortunately, I haven't had to deal with a stolen card number yet, but knowing that I have that added security is very nice.
- Rewards
    - Pretty much every credit card offers rewards these days. You already know you have to spend money on essentials like food and transportation and you're likely consistently spending money on non-essentials as well, so why not get rewarded for those purchases? I have a credit card that lets me get 2% cash back on every purchase, so it's almost like I get free money on every purchase, or everything I buy costs 2% less!
- No Annual Fee
    - Some credit cards require you to pay a yearly subscription fee, but some don't! You can get many of these credit card benefits without having to pay for a yearly subscription. I personally don't have any cards that require me to pay an annual fee.
- Allows You to Build Good Credit
    - I haven't needed to take out a loan yet, but if/when I do, I can expect a lower interest rate when paying back loans if I have a good credit score. To increase/maintain a good credit score, I pay my bills in full and on time. A good score shows creditors that you are responsible with your money and they will be less worried about losing their money since you have reliably shown that you can pay back owed money.

Of course, there can be consequences to owning a credit card as well - but these consequences generally only happen when you don't pay credit card bills.
- Increased Interest
    - When you get a bill, you generally have options to pay off the minimum balance, the statement balance, or the current balance. If you pay enough to meet the minimum requirement, but not enough to meet the statement requirement, the difference will be carried over to future bills and accrue interest (calculated based on your card's annual percentage rate or APR value) - so you end up paying more for your purchases than you otherwise would have. If you start missing some payments, that APR (interest) value could go up. I don't think my interest rate has increased, but I also haven't been paying too much attention to that value because I always pay off my statement in full. 
- Late Fees
    - If you miss a payment and pay it off later after the deadline, you'll likely incur some sort of late fee that you also have to pay. I haven't had to pay a late fee and this repercussion can be avoided by paying bills in full and on time.
- Lowers your Credit Score
    - Just like having a credit card could raise your score, it could also lower your score. It all depends on whether or not you're paying your bills. Once again, if you don't want a lower credit score, pay bills in full and on time.

I personally have not had to deal with any of these consequences of owning a credit card. To avoid the consequences, there are two rules I abide by when using a credit card:
1. Treat your credit card as if it was a debit card - meaning don't spend more than you have. Only make purchases if you could theoretically pay for it with hard cash you own.
2. Pay billing statements in full and on time (have I said this enough? it's important haha). As mentioned earlier, this will allow you to reap the benefits of having a credit card without suffering any of the negative consequences.

It can be a bit hard to qualify for a card when you don't have an established credit background. If you're just starting out, the [Discover it®](https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/cash-back/it-card.html) card is one that I recommend and one that might be a bit easier to obtain as a fresh college graduate that's just starting to work. This card lets you get 5% cash back on specific purchases per quarter and 1% on everything else. Plus, for the first year of use, the cash back you get is actually doubled, so essentially you're getting 10% of your money back per quarter and 2% on everything else for the first year. Another popular card is the [Chase Freedom Unlimited®](https://creditcards.chase.com/cash-back-credit-cards/freedom/unlimited) card which can get you a $200 bonus, 1.5% cash back on all purchases, and more. There are a lot of options when it comes to credit cards, so choose the ones that work best for you.

### Contribute to Your 401(k)
A 401(k) is a retirement plan that is sponsored by the employer you work for. There are several different types of 401(k) plans, but I'm only going to talk about the types I've dealt with, which would probably be considered the "two main types" of plans you would see at big corporations. The two plans are the Traditional 401(k) and the Roth 401(k).

Before we talk about the differences between the two types, let's try to more thoroughly understand what a 401(k) is and how it works.

A 401(k) is a retirement plan that is sponsored by your employer. Establishing a 401(k) means you are working with your company to set up a retirement account for yourself. After the account is set up (which is pretty much already done for you as soon as you start working), you can begin setting aside a portion of your paycheck earnings to be put into that account. Every year, the IRS announces the limit for how much money an employee can contribute to his/her retirement account for an entire year. For the year 2021, the limit is $19,500. The limits can change slightly from year to year based on a multitude of reasons, so it's important to check what the limit is at the beginning of every new year.

The main difference between a Traditional 401(k) and a Roth 401(k) is when income taxes are paid off. A contribution to a Traditional 401(k) must be made with "before-tax" dollars and a contribution to a Roth 401(k) must be made with "after-tax" dollars - but what does this mean? Let me illustrate this with a severely simplified example.

Suppose you just got a paycheck for $1,000 and you set aside $200 of that $1,000 into your 401(k) retirement account. Currently, your income tax rate is 10%.

Let's say you put that $200 into a Traditional 401(k) plan. When calculating how much income tax you have to pay on your $1000 paycheck, you deduct $200 from your $1000 before multiplying by 10% to get a total of $80 owed in taxes. So at this point, you pay the $80 tax, take home $720 with you, and have $200 in the retirement account. 40 years later, that intial $200 has grown to $20,000, the income tax rate has changed from 10% to 15%, and you still have that $720. Now, you want to make a withdrawl of $1,000. When you withdraw that $1,000, you calculate your tax to be $1,000 multiplied by 15% which is $150. So you pay the $150 tax and take the rest of the $850 home. If we look at the final numbers now, you spent a total of $230 ($80 + $150) in taxes, you have a total of $1,570 ($720 + $850) cash on hand, and $19,000 in your Traditional 401(k) plan.

Now, let's start with the same initial conditions of $1,000, $200, and 10% and see how the taxes are different when using a Roth 401(k).

Let's say you put that $200 into a Roth 401(k) plan. When calculating how much income tax you have to pay on your $1000 paycheck, you multiply the full $1000 by 10% to get a total of $100 owed in taxes. So at this point, you pay the $100 tax, take home $700 with you, and have $200 in the retirement account. 40 years later, that intial $200 has grown to $20,000, the income tax rate has changed from 10% to 15%, and you still have that $700. Now, you want to make a withdrawl of $1,000. When you withdraw that $1,000, you withdraw the full $1,000 and pay $0 in tax. If we look at the final numbers now, you spent a total of $100 ($100 + $0) in taxes, you have a total of $1,700 ($700 + $1000) cash on hand, and $19,000 in your Roth 401(k) plan.

So as we can see, when people say that a Traditional 401(k) contribution is made using "before-tax" dollars, they mean that the money you put into the account that comes from a portion of your paycheck does not get taxed (yet). The initial deposit and its subsequent growth gets taxed when you take out the money after retirement. When people say that a Roth 401(k) contribution is made using "after-tax" dollars, they mean that the money you into the account that comes from a portion of of your paycheck does get taxed. The initial deposit and its subsequent growth does not get taxed when you take out the money after retirement.

So which option is better, and which type should you invest in? Based on the example above, you might think the Roth 401(k) is better

Personally, I am currently putting all my money in a traditional 401(k).

A lot of the times, the company will match a certain percentage of your salaray as a contribution. keep in mind though that the matches are spread out over many paychekcs over the year - no one is gonna give you the $10000 up front in the first month, therefore you must spread out your retirement contributions such that you hit the IRS limit right at the last paycheck so you get the full company match

So which strategy is better? It's hard to tell without knowing the specifics of your situation.
You can't go wrong in the sense that no matter which you pick, you;ll hopefully have enough to live a comfortable retirement. But to answer which one would net you more value is hard to say.

Both, as long as the limit of both ads up to 19500

### IRAs

### Understand your paycheck

### Tracking your spending and earnings
So I actually started doing that this month, but I should have done this way, way earlier.

### Paying off Debts
So, I can't speak much on this point because I don't have any experience with what a good chunk of you experience debt. However, I'm a firm believer in paying off debts as soon and as quickly as possible.

If you're like me, you've finished your bachelor's degree and landed a good job and. I was also fortunate enough to graduate without accruing any student loan debt through a combination of scholarships, enrolling in a in-state school, and financial support from family - a luxury that I am aware that many people do not have.

This isn't applicable to me, but i think is worth mentioning. I would pay off loans as soon as possible

Tips
Treat your credit card like a debit card. Pretend money you are spending today
Make your sure contribute enough to your retirement account so you are getting the full company match
Learn pay stub
keep track of spending and growth

title: Applying to Graduate School
---

I graduated from my undergrad program back in December 2018, a little over two years ago now. I was elated in the weeks leading up to graduation day because I frequently thought about how after 3.5 years of hitting the uni books and 12+ years of enrollment in institutional education before that, I was finally going to finish schooling and consequently begin a transition into real adulthood.

By no means was I decidedly done with academic learning. On the contrary, I always intended to obtain a graduate degree in the future - I just hadn't settled on exactly when. Maybe I would go directly into a grad school program after graduation, or maybe I would wait and work a few years or something before going back to school.

I actually made the decision pretty early on in my undergraduate career that after getting my bachelor's, I wanted to go work in industry, and so I did just that. Interestingly enough, I found myself enrolled in graduate school before a full year of work had even passed. I guess I missed school that much or something, idk :joy:

Obviously, there are a lot of different graduate opportunities a person can pursue. The application requirements for med school are going to differ from the requirements for law school, which are going to differ from some other program, and so on. Maybe you want to immediately jump into a PhD program or maybe you're just looking to get a Master's degree. While the application process in each case may share some commonalities, many requirements will vary depending on the type of program you're gunning for. If you're like me and you're just looking to obtain a classic Master's degree, you might find the information here very applicable to your situation. So, without further ado, here are the steps I took, mixed in with my tips and experiences, to apply to graduate school.

### 1. Determine what schools you will apply to
The start of the application process begins with figuring out which schools you will apply to. Things to consider when applying to schools:
- Number of Schools: I would recommend applying to more than one school. As confident as you may be about getting accepted by your top pick, there are no guarantees and you can never be too sure. Two applications is solid but less than two is a bit risky. I personally submitted three graduate applications.
- Location: One big reason I chose to move to Chicago was that it would put in an area filled with universities, so if I elected to start going to back to school, I would be within reach of lots of great schools. It also gave me the chance to work while taking classes since everything is in the same centralized area. If you plan on relocating and going back to a being a full-time student, location probably doesn't matter as much.
- Cost: Make sure you can afford the cost of attending. Also, a lot of the times, tuition is covered if you do research or if you work as a graduate teaching assistant.

### 2. Prepare and take the GRE
Many schools require/recommend you to submit GRE scores in your application. If you are like me and you aren't the best at standardized testing, I would try to start prepping at a minimum 3-4 months before applications are due, if not earlier. I would also schedule an exam, at the very latest, a month before your first application is due. For those of you that have taken the SAT, I personally think taking the GRE feels pretty similar to taking the SAT except, of course, the material is scaled for a student with a college education. One annoying nuance of the GRE is that some of the presented multiple choice problems have more than one correct answer and you must pick all of them in order to get full credit.

A GRE score is good for five years, so if you decide last minute not to attend, you can still use the score if you apply again within the five month timeframe. If you're a college student, this means you have the option to take the GRE before your senior year if it works out better for you scheduling-wise.

One of my schools I applied to told me they would accept either a GRE score or a GMAT score. When I took practice tests for both exams, I performed slightly better on the GMAT exam, so if your school accepts exams other than the GRE, you should definitely consider the alternatives if you perform better on them.

### 3. Get Recommendation Letters
Typically, a graduate application will require two or three letters of recommendation. For my applications, I asked for recommendation letters from my manager, mentor from work, and one of my computer science professors from Purdue.

Getting a letter from an academic professor is valuable because, well, they are academic professionals. They know what it takes to be successful in academia. It only makes sense to have an academic recommend you as you are applying to be an academic student. The university which you are applying to will also gain better insight on how you will perform as a student in a university setting.

If you are in college right now and you haven't made a good connection with a professor, I would highly recommend establishing at least one. If you've graduated and never made one, it's still worth reaching out to your past professors, especially if you did well in their class. Though not ideal, in reality, professors are used to getting requests from students they may not have known very well and they still write letters of rec for them. It's more common than you may think and it doesn't hurt to reach out.

Remember, your recommenders are allocating time out of their days to write your letters so make sure you send them a thank you to show your appreciation!

### 4. Write your Statement of Purpose
The statement of purpose is a written **statement** explains your **purpose** for pursuing a graduate degree. It is probably the most important part of the application. It allows you to add a personal human element to your application and gives you the chance to really persuade and convince the admissions office on why you should be accepted into their graduate program. Typical questions you would have to address in your statement include:
- Why should the university offer you admission as a student?
- What is your motivation for pursing advanced study your specified field?
- What do you intend to do after completing the degree?

Write out a draft of your statement early on so you have a chance to come back and review before submitting. It may also be helpful to have someone else look over and proofread your short essay.

### 5. Send transcript(s)
No surprise here - schools need your transcript from your undergrad years as part of the application process.

Something to keep in mind, as this may apply to you as well: Back in high school, I enrolled in a few dual-course classes. This meant classes I took in high school counted as college credit classes as well. One of the schools I applied to specifically said they wanted every college transcript I have on record. As a result, I had to call up Indiana University and ask them to send a copy of my transcript to the school I was applying to. This wasn't a big deal at all, but just something to make a note of if you also earned college credit in high school.

### 6. Keep Your Resume Updated
Some applications may ask you to submit your resume. This is especially important if you went straight to work after obtaining your bachelor's, like me. Ideally, the content on your resume is applicable to the program which you are applying to.

### 7. Submit Your Applications
After getting everything together, there's nothing left to do but submit your applications and wait for a response. Best of luck, I hope you get in!
